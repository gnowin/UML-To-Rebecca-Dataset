Here is the translation of the provided PlantUML diagram into Rebeca (Reactive Objects Language) code for the Messenger, Receiver, and Medium:

env boolean networkReliability = true;

reactiveclass Messenger(5) {
    knownrebecs {
        Medium medium;
    }
    statevars {
        boolean sendBit;
        boolean hasSucceeded;
    }

    Messenger() {
        sendBit = false;
        hasSucceeded = false;
        self.sendMsg();
    }

    msgsrv sendMsg() {
        medium.pass(sendBit);
    }

    msgsrv receive(boolean status) {
        hasSucceeded = status;
        sendBit = !sendBit; // Toggle the bit for sending alternate messages
        self.sendMsg();
    }
}

reactiveclass Receiver(2) {
    knownrebecs {
        Messenger messenger;
    }
    statevars {
        boolean messageBit;
    }

    Receiver() {
        messageBit = false;
    }

    msgsrv receiveMsg(boolean msgBit) {
        messageBit = msgBit;
        messenger.receive(true);
    }
}

reactiveclass Medium(3) {
    knownrebecs {
        Receiver receiver;
        Messenger messenger;
    }
    statevars {
        boolean passMessage;
    }

    Medium() {
        passMessage = true;
    }

    msgsrv pass(boolean msgBit) {
        // Simulate network reliability randomness
        passMessage = (Math.random() > 0.5) ? true : networkReliability;
        if (passMessage) {
            receiver.receiveMsg(msgBit);
        } else {
            messenger.receive(false);
        }
    }
}

main {
    Medium medium():();
    Messenger messenger(medium):();
    Receiver receiver(messenger):();
    medium.setKnownRebecs(receiver, messenger);
}

This code assumes the following functionalities:

    Messenger sends a message through the Medium, toggling its send bit each time to simulate sending different messages.
    Receiver receives messages and confirms to the Messenger that the message was successfully received.
    Medium simulates a potentially unreliable network where messages may or may not get passed through. It randomly decides whether to pass the message to the Receiver or inform the Messenger of a failure based on a simplistic simulation of network reliability.

This scenario is somewhat simplified and assumes ideal conditions where the message passing and status checking happen without delay or error, except for simulated network issues.

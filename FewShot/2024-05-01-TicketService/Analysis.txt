Correct:
All message servers, statevariables and knownrebecs are present.
Reactiveclass Customer is correct and almost identical to the original code.
Reactiveclass Agent is correct and almost identical to the original code.


Wrong:
Code did not run due to 2 errors.
    1. In main, parantases for TicketService, TicketService ticketService: (); istead of TicketService ticketService(): ();
    2. In the reactiveclass TicketService, parantases and questionmark,  delay(delayMin, delayMax); istead of delay(?(delayMin, delayMax));

Created one costumer instead of two
Empty constructor in TicketService
Created 2 env variables: delayMin and DelayMax which was used for the delay in the reactiveclass TicketService.

There are no deadline in the reactiveclass Agent.

Notes:
Code was satisfied when the errors were fixed.

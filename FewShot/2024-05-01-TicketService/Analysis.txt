Notes:
For this few shot, we turned of a setting in ChatGPT-4 that should prevent it from learning from what we give as input.
In this way, the experiment should be able to be reproduced. However, ChatGPT-4 is not deterministic so the result may be different.

Code was satisfied when the errors were fixed.
Number of Reached States: 10
Number of Reached translations: 12

When adding one more costumer:
Number of Reached States: 699
Number of Reached translations: 827

Correct:
All message servers, statevariables and knownrebecs are present.
Reactiveclass Customer is correct and almost identical to the original code.
Reactiveclass Agent is correct and almost identical to the original code.


Wrong:
Code did not run due to 2 errors.
    1. In main, parantases for TicketService, TicketService ticketService: (); istead of TicketService ticketService(): ();
    2. In the reactiveclass TicketService, parantases and questionmark,  delay(delayMin, delayMax); istead of delay(?(delayMin, delayMax));

Created one costumer instead of two
Empty constructor in TicketService
Created 2 env variables: delayMin and DelayMax which was used for the delay in the reactiveclass TicketService.

There are no deadline in the reactiveclass Agent.

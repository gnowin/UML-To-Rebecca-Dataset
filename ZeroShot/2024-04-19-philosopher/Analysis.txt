Correct:
Message servers are defined correctly.

All message servers present in the generated code.

Wrong:
Queue size declaration is wrong. Instead of number there is "int id", which looks more like a parameter definition.

There is a keyword "state" that is not defined in the Rebeca language. ChatGPT attempted to define the states of the PlantUML directly into the code.

There is no constructor, but there seems to be for example "initial p_A { !eat; !fL; !fR; }" instead. It sets the variables to their correct initial value, but there are no defined statevars.

The logic inside message servers are either missing, using "state" that does not exist or is wrong.

Main is missing.

Correct:
reactiveclasses defines queue size correctly

The logic and if statements seem to mostly be correct. If the syntax worked, then the model might too.

Wrong:
In the result, it explains the code as a code skeleton. It should be a fully working example.

No constructors.

statevars not defined correctly. Using keyword "state" (old syntax)?

Creates two identical train classes.

No knownrebecs defined.

In t1 and t2, sending message to message servers in controller is done wrong. "main.controller!Arrive(self)". Kind of like its trying to message the controller rebec without any knownrebec.

main is close to correct, but for example "Controller controller():{};" instead of "Controller controller():();".

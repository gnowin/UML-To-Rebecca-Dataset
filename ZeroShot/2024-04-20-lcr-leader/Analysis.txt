Correct:
knownrebec is defined correctly.

Constructor was done done with the correct syntax, but missed parameter "byte n".

If statement logic is correct in recieve.

Wrong:
No statevars were generated and also not instantiated in the constructor.

Tries to set a value for currentLeader, but it is not done as a statevar or with the right value.

Uses "state" keyword that does not exist (at least not in newest rebeca version).

Using keyword "setState" that does not exist.

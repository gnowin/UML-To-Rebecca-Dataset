To translate your PlantUML diagram into Rebeca (Reactive Objects Language) code, it's essential to first understand the roles and behaviors illustrated in the diagram and then map them into Rebecaâ€™s syntax. Rebeca is an actor-based language where each actor (referred to as a "rebec") reacts to messages asynchronously.

Here's how we can interpret and translate the PlantUML diagram into Rebeca code:

    States: The diagram specifies two states, node_A and node_B.
    Transitions:
        Transition from [*] to node_A triggered by {self.send()}.
        Self-loop on node_A upon receiving receive(n) with specific conditions and actions.
        Transition from node_A to node_B when a certain condition (n == myNumber) is met.
        Self-loop on node_B as a leader confirming itself.

Given this interpretation, the Rebeca code would look something like this:

reactiveclass Node (int myNumber)
{
    state non_leader, leader;
    
    knownrebecs {
        Node rightNode;
    }

    int currentLeader = 0;

    Node() {
        self.send();
        setState(non_leader);
    }

    msgsrv send() {
        rightNode.receive(currentLeader);
    }

    msgsrv receive(int n) {
        if (n > currentLeader) {
            currentLeader = n;
            self.send();
        }
        if (n == myNumber) {
            self.ImLeader();
        }
    }

    msgsrv ImLeader() {
        setState(leader);
        // Additional logic for leader
    }
}

Explanation

    reactiveclass: This is how actors are defined in Rebeca. Node is the reactive class with one parameter myNumber.
    state: We use the state keyword to define possible states (non_leader, leader), which help manage different behaviors within the reactive class.
    knownrebecs: This section defines other rebecs that this actor knows about and can communicate with. Here, rightNode is another instance of Node.
    Node(): This is the constructor for the Node class. It initializes the actor's state and triggers the first action.
    msgsrv: This keyword defines a message-serving method, which is how Rebeca handles incoming messages. send(), receive(int n), and ImLeader() are all message services handling different logic.

This code implements a simple leader election algorithm as suggested by your diagram, where nodes communicate to identify a leader based on message passing. The transitions are reflected in message handling and state changes.

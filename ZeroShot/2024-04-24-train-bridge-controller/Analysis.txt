Correct:

Created one class for train

Knowrebecs defiend correcly in train

The logic and if statements seem to mostly be correct. If the syntax worked, then the model might too.

Wrong:

No constructors.

statevars not defined correctly. Using keyword "state" (old syntax)?

reactiveclasses defines queue size false

No knownrebecs defined in controller.

knownrebecs.train1.YouMayPass(); instead of t2.YouMayPass();


main is close to correct,     
    Controller c();
    Train train1(1)(c);
    Train train2(2)(c);

Instead of;
    Train train1(theController):();
    Train train2(theController):();
    BridgeController theController(train1, train2):();
